    description:
      "BIGonDRY srl has developed reduced investment compact plants, using direct heating systems without avoiding the installation of boilers and plumbing. Exchange circuits with high efficiency (up to 95-98%) run this type of plants, using conventional fuels (gas and diesel). These plants are engineered to optimize consumption and minimize first investment and operating costs. Static or dynamic plants with frontal or carriage loading can be built in order to optimize loading and unloading dynamics and minimize all costs of handling, whose crucial impact would lead to higher costs during short process cycles.",

    description:
      "THW is the line of machinery for the thermal modification of the wood with high temperature. This range of plants goes from a net capacity of 4 m³ up to approximately 30 m³, with a very precise and sophisticated management system. BIGonDRY Srl is also focused on eco-sustainable processes and the construction of eco-friendly systems in order to create a development opportunity but with attention to optimizing energy consumption, combining the best relationship between quality and price. To summarize, BIGonDRY built a technologically advanced and extremely versatile machine that can do different treatments as: Drying, Steaming, Heat treatment according to ISPM-15 Standards, High termperature treatment up to 250°C, Thermo-steaming of the wood, with enormous advantages in terms of consumption and environmental impact thanks to the reduced emission into the atmosphere and the advanced electronic control that guarantees excellent results in the property of the wood. A very sophisticated electronic control system guarantees excellent results on wood with dark and homogeneous color tones throughout the thickness. This innovative system of heat treatment plant at high temperatures gives the wood characteristics of durability and stability, without chemical additives on the wood. The thermally modified wood reduces shrinkage and swelling and improves resistance against pest infestation.",
