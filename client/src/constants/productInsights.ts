  title: "Direct Steaming",
  description:
    "The steam is injected into the compartment containing the wood through a series of perforated pipes under the stack, along the three walls. The steam must be saturated or nearly saturated, with a maximum pressure of 0.3 bar (in the pipeline) and must expand in the cell until it reaches atmospheric pressure. If you do not have saturated steam, it must be moistened (the steam is blown against the water made to enter under the steam tube in a special channel). The holes in the pipe must be turned towards the floor and not against the wood in order not to cause local overheating and drying.",

  title: "Indirect Steaming",
  description:
    "The steam is produced inside the vaporization cell by bringing the water contained in special stainless steel tanks to a boil, arranged below the floor level, along the three walls not affected by the door, under the stack. Inside these tanks there is a traditional / direct heating coil in which superheated water / gas flows as a thermal agent. Using this system it is necessary to keep the water level in the tanks constant.",
